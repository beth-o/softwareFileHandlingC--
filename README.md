software file handling system
assignment for Data Structures, create a software inventory system using file handling. I used an ItemClass for my 
structure definition. Read file stream and imported into class objects that were placed in an array of objects, then 
sorted using a tree algorithm (could use help with this). Input from user to search, update, delete or add software inventory 
items. Prompt user to save updated information to the file.
